## Terms

- Feature: a category of data points that affect the value of a _label_. Independent variable.
- Label: The output of our algorithm
- Classification: The value of our labels belong to a _discrete_ set. A discrete set is a small number of possible values. (ex: spam, not spam, maybe spam)
- Regression: The value of our labels belong to a _continuous_ set. A continuous set is usually a range between two bounds. (ex: $1-$1,000,000.00, 1lb-500lb)

## Problem Solving Process

1. Identify data that is relevant to the problem
2. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you are trying to solve
3. Decide on the type of output you are predicting
4. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between you 'feature' and 'labels'
5. Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction

## Plinko

A ball is dropped into a board with staggered peggs and 10 buckets. Given the balls starting point, how bouncy it is, and how large it is, which bucket is the ball most likely to fall into? Here, the features are the drop point, the bouncincess, and the size.
